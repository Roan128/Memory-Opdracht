# Memory game application
The application was made as an project for the module 'programmeren in C#'. The objective was to make a memory game in a console application and an GUI application. 

I choose to use the WPF framework for the GUI.

## Goals
- Game can be played in a GUI and console application.
- The player can give the amount of card he wants to play with in the GUI application. In the console the default is 5.
- In the gui application, the player can use his own images.
- The images will be saved to the database as an set.
- Implement the application in layers so the layers can be isolated and tested. (DAL, BLL)
- The score can be saved.
- There is a highscore display in the GUI and console application.
